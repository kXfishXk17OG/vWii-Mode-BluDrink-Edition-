# vWii-Mode-BluDrink-Edition-
BEFORE YOU INSTALL ANY MODS THAT USE BLUDRINK MOD, DO NOT UNPLUG YOUR WII U DURING THE INSTALLATION OR ITS BRICKED!!!

Play your Wii games on your Wii U GamePad via USBLoader GX. This will remove the restriction that wont let you use the GamePad in vWii Mode. vWii Mode BluDrink Edition requires The Homebrew Channel installed on your vWii, USBLoader GX, and WUP Installer GX so that you will be able to install the app on your Wii U.

BluDrink Mod, BluDrink, Fish, and kXfishXk are all trademarked by kXfishXk Games Studio except for USBLoaderGX.
